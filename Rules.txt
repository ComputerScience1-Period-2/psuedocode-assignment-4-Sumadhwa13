Assignment 4: Speed Card Game Rules

Speed requires a standard deck of 52 cards
Only two players can play
The numerical value placed on each card is the value used in this game
For non-numerical cards: Ace = 1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13
During play, you must place a card of one value above or below the card on top of the selected center stack
You can place an Ace on top of a King, and a King on top of an Ace
Jokers can be placed as wild cards (ex: if there is a 3 in the center, a joker can be used as a 4, or a 2)
Any card can be played on a joker
Multiple cards can be placed at one time
If the number of cards in any player's hand drops below five:
	he/she must draw back up to five cards by taking cards from their draw pile
If both players run out of viable cards to play:
	they must simultaneously flip one card each from both of the replacement piles onto the top of the two center stacks (one card on top of each center stack)
If the replacement piles lose all of their cards and both players run out of viable cards to play:
	shuffle the center stacks and create new replacement piles (keep two face up cards on each center stack to resume play)
A player wins by running out of cards in their hand and their draw pile before the other player
	That specific player MUST hit both center stacks and say "Speed!" to win
	If this player does not do the instruction listed above:
		They must take one of the center stacks as their draw pile and continue play
